# Refined Knapsack

Problem Statement:  

Refined Knapsack(recursive) using dynamic programming  
•	The objective was to reduce the time complexity of knapsack problem for dynamic programming  
•	For the input, random values are automatically generated at each run  
•	Determination of essential elements where the values are modified  
•	Conducted calculation only for essential elements by using dynamic algorithm for KS; this saves time by not having to calculate every element at each sub step  
•	Displays the Knapsack table and the chosen elements, the time complexity for this approach is O(nW) compared to O(2n)  

## 'make' to compile
## to run './Rdynamic'

NOTE:
## The outputs and inputs are as stated in original document.
